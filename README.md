Escuelita de AI_da: AI Literacy & Social Appropriation

Project Description
This repository hosts the resources, methodological guides, and prompt libraries developed for Escuelita de AI_da. This initiative focuses on digital literacy aimed at bridging the generational technological divide.
The project approaches Generative Artificial Intelligence not from a purely technical perspective, but through a humanistic and anthropological lens, prioritizing ethical understanding, practical utility, and the integration of these tools into the daily lives of non-digital natives.

Core Objectives
Democratization of Access: Facilitating the understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) for users without engineering backgrounds.
Critical Thinking Development: Encouraging interaction with AI that goes beyond passive consumption, promoting the ability to question and direct the machine effectively.
Preservation of Human Agency: Teaching the use of AI as a support tool that does not replace human judgment or life experience.

Repository Structure

📂 /Curriculum: Learning modules structured by proficiency levels (Basic / Intermediate).

📂 /Prompts_Library: A collection of instructions optimized for daily tasks, creativity, and analysis, culturally validated.
